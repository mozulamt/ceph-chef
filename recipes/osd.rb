# NOTE: Example of an OSD device to add. You can find other examples in the OSD attribute file and the
# environment file. The device and the journal should be the same IF you wish the data and journal to be
# on the same device (ceph default). However, if you wish to have the data on device by itself (i.e., HDD)
# and the journal on a different device (i.e., SSD) then give the cooresponding device name for the given
# entry (device or journal). The command 'ceph-disk prepare' will keep track of partitions for journals
# so DO NOT create a device with partitions already configured and then attempt to use that as the journal:
# device value. Journals are raw devices (no file system like xfs).

    # The proplem below is that we want to know what partition# was created (if
    # any) by 'ceph-disk prepare'. If the disk was empty, it will probably be
    # #1. If the disk was NOT empty, then it's the next free number. Then it's
    # figuring out what the correct naming of the partition is. It might be
    # just a numeric suffix, or a 'p'+suffix or '-part'+suffix.
    #
    # prepare takes a raw device for both data & journal and makes partitions
    # on both as needed.
    #
    # list takes a raw device as well, not a partition, also drop the /dev/ prefix.
    #
    # activate takes a PARTITION if applicable.
    #
    # As a hack for now, if the device is MAYBE partitionable, try to run
    # 'ceph-disk list' on it and take the first entry that matches 'ceph data'
    #
    # * Maybe partitionable defined as:
    # - exists in /sys/block/$X/
    # - /sys/block/$X/ext_range is >1 (TODO)
    # - /sys/block/$X/capability does not have 0x0200 set (TODO: GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN)
    #
    # TODO: Fix this for future things that might have more than one data
    # volume on a disk.
    # TODO: we do readlink for the moment to resolve symlinks, but we should
    # resolve the rdev major/minor to get the canonical name.
    #
    # Other unworkable solutions:
    # Chef resource ordering means that we'd have to try and scan the partition
    # table below & after running ceph-disk and figure out the difference.
